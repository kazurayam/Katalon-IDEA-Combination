=== Problem1-12 How to print Classpath

I worked on constructing the classpath for the `lib` subproject. How does the content of classpath look like?

I made a Gradle task `printClasspath` in the `lib` subproject.

[source,text]
----
include::../lib/build.gradle[lines=93..99]
----

When I ran the `printClasspath` by

[source,text]
----
$ ./gradlew :lib:printClasspath
----

I got the following output:

[source,text]
----
include::./assets/classpath.txt[]
----

I could confirm that the classpath now includes `groovy-3.0.17.jar` and many others.
