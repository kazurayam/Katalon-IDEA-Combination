=== The resolution

I invented a magic spell: `io.github.kazurayam.ks.configuration.RunConfigurationConfigurator`. Later I will explain what it does. See how it works as in the following JUnit test:

- link:{TreeURL}/lib/listTestObjects/Script1746006212468.groovy[`lib/src/test/groovy/com/kms/katalon/core/configuration/RunConfigurationPassingTest.groovy`]

[source,text]
----
include::../lib/src/test/groovy/com/kms/katalon/core/configuration/RunConfigurationPassingTest.groovy[]
----

When I ran this JUnit test, it passed. This means, a call to `RunConfiguration.getProjectDir()` in a JUnit test in the `lib` subproject successfully returned the path of the `katalon` subproject. The issue has been resolved!
