=== Description

I developed 2 Groovy classes in the `lib` subproject. These classes enabled me to resolve the aforementioned problems.

==== `KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver`

- link:{TreeURL}/lib/src/main/groovy/io/github/kazurayam/ks/configuration/KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver.groovy[`io.github.kazurayam.ks.configuration.KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver`]

[source,groovy]
----
include::../lib/src/main/groovy/io/github/kazurayam/ks/configuration/KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver.groovy[]
----

The static `KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver.getProjectDir()` method will return a Path object, which is the `katalon` subproject's root folder.

When the method is called inside Katalon Studio runtime, the method simply returns a non-null value returned by `RunConfiguration.getProjectDir()`.

When the `RunConfiguration.getProjectDir()` returned null, the method presumes that it was invoked in the sibling `lib` subproject, and returns a path `../katalon` relative to the `lib` subproject.

As you can perceive, the `KatalonProjectDirectoryResolver` is NOT reusable; it is designed to be used solely in the `lib` subproject of this `Katalon-IDEA-Combination` project.

==== `RunConfigurationConfigurator`

- link:{TreeURL}/lib/src/main/groovy/io/github/kazurayam/ks/configuration/RunConfigurationConfigurator.groovy[`io.github.kazurayam.ks.configuration.RunConfigurationConfigurator`]

[source,groovy]
----
include::../lib/src/main/groovy/io/github/kazurayam/ks/configuration/RunConfigurationConfigurator.groovy[]
----

When the `RunConfigurationConfigurator.configureProjectDir()` is called anywhere inside the `lib` subproject, it will alter the internal state of the singleton instance of `com.kms.katalon.core.configuration.RunConfiguration` class. See the following junit5 test:

- link:{TreeURL}/lib/src/test/groovy/com/kms/katalon/core/configuration/RunConfigurationPassingTest.groovy[]

[source,text]
----
include::../lib/src/test/groovy/com/kms/katalon/core/configuration/RunConfigurationPassingTest.groovy[]
----

This test will pass, which proves that, once configured, the call to `RunConfiguration.getProjectDir()` will return the path of sibling `katalon` subproject.

Provided with the `RunConfigurationConfigurator` class, I could develop good number of unit-test in the `lib` subproject while utilizing the files in the`katalon` as the test fixture. In fact, my codes in the `lib` subproject could get access to any resources inside the `katalon` subproject: Test Objects, Test Case scripts, Test Listeners, Test Suites, Profiles.

You may ask me what this line does.

You should read the source code of the `com.kms.katalon.core.configuration.RunConfiguration` class. The source code is bundled with every Katalon Studio installation. On Windows, you would find it here:

- `<Katalon Studio installation folder>/configuration/resources/source/com.kms.katalon.core/com.kms.katalon.core-sources.jar`
