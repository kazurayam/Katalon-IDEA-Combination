== Conclusion

I made a Gradle Multiproject with 2 subprojects: `katalon` and `lib`. I could develop a set of custom classes that extends my Katalon project's capability in the `lib` subproject. I used IntelliJ IDEA with JUnit5 and Gradle. I could import the custom classes into the `katalon` subproject. Katalon studio could utilize the custom classes without any problem.

I believe that I could seamlessly combine Katalon Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
